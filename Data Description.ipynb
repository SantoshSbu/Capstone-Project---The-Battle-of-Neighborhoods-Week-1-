We will need a list of Toronto neighborhoods broken down by postal code.\nI start with finding a list of Toronto Neighbor hoods with postal code from Wikipedia and load this data as my working base.<br>\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n\n### 2.  We will need a list of Toronto neighborhoods populations broken down by postal code\nImport a list of populations by postal code<br>\nhttps://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Tables/File.cfm?T=1201&SR=1&RPP=9999&PR=0&CMA=0&CSD=0&S=22&O=A&Lang=Eng&OFT=CSV<br>\n\n### 3. We will need a list of Toronto neighborhoods average after tax income broken down by postal code\nHere we must manually download these from Stats Canada and load them.<br>\nhttps://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/search-recherche/change-geo.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FSA<br>\nSee: to_geo_space.csv\n\n### 4.

We will need a list of all Restaurant Venues from all neighborhoods in Toronto by Postal code\nWe use 4SQUARE API to download all venues from all neighborhoods in Toronto. <br>\nhttps://api.foursquare.com<br>\nExtract Restaurants and only include Restaurants in our Data Set.<br>\n\n### 6. Combine all of those into a working Data Set to cluster and geo spatial map of the results showing the best neighborhood to open a Restaurant Supply Store<br>\n\nCombining all of these disparate data sets will clearly demonstrate the following:\n- which neighborhoods in Toronto have clusters of like Restaurants\n- how populated each neighborhoods is\n- the average after tax income is all of these neighborhoods\n- which neighborhood should he target to open his new store.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
